        <h1><u>Brief Of IOT</u></h1>
        <h3>The Internet of Things (IoT) is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles and other objects which consists of an embedded system with sensors, actuators and network connectivity that enable to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed and/or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for more integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and result in improved accuracy, efficiency and economic benefi. <br></br>The IoT is a rapidly increasing and promising technology which becomes more and more present in our everyday lives. Furthermore, the technology is an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes and smart cities<br></br>Considering the high-rate development of IoT technologies, and the significant increment in the number of the connected devices, comprehensive overview of the IoT system aims, architecture, challenges, applications, protocols, and market overview was discussed. In order to give an example of IoT solution, a simple IoT demonstrator was implemented using the current affordable hardware, and cloud efficient software.</h3>
